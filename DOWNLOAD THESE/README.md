# Notes

These mods aren't my original work, I've just converted them to work with QMod Manager Reloaded which uses Harmony2.0.

All these have been tested on the GOG and Steam versions, on an English operating system, using an English game client.

If you have any issues, please provide the below and I'll take a look.

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\Lazy Bear Games\Graveyard Keeper\Player.log
..\Graveyard Keeper\qmod_reloaded_log.txt

Please delete both logs and test the game again so it generates fresh logs with only relevant entries.
