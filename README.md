# Graveyard Keeper Harmony1 to Harmony2 Mod Conversions

These mods aren't my original work, I've just converted them to work with QMod Manager Reloaded which uses Harmony2.0. If an author updates (correctly) directly on Nexus, I will remove from this repo.
 
 QMod Manager Reloaded  - https://github.com/p1xel8ted/GYK-QModManagerReloaded
 
 Graveyard Keeper QMods - https://github.com/p1xel8ted/GYK-Mods-QMod
 
 Short of updating mod code for game changes, this is the only change required to convert Harmony1 to 2 (and reference the Harmony2 DLL).
 
 # Harmony 1 Patch Method
 
 ```c#
 using Harmony;
 
 HarmonyInstance.Create("p1xel8ted.GraveyardKeeper.TheSeedEqualizer").PatchAll(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
 ```
 # Harmony 2 Patch Method
 
```c#
using HarmonyLib;

var harmony = new Harmony("p1xel8ted.GraveyardKeeper.TheSeedEqualizer");
harmony.PatchAll(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```
